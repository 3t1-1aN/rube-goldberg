# rube-goldberg
code for a custom rube goldberg machine I made in a mechatronics class.
Uses a sound sensor to operate a pan tilt mechanism that holds a magnet to activate a reed sensor which activates a laser module to activate a photoresistor which then activates a servo to drop a marble down a ramp
